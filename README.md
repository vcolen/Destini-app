## Hey guys! This app is a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience

### The goal of this project was to better fixate the conceps learned on the [Quizzler app](https://github.com/vcolen/Quizzler-app) lesson. Which were:
* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Swift Structures how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types. 
* Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organised.

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
